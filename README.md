# Gloria Player

This is a simple client server signage player created for my church. It was built couple years ago as weekend project, there are some libraries used that are alredy discontinued / depracated. Hence, there are a lot of rooms for future improvement. 

Gloria Player is installed in Intel NUC. The admin will access the web server exposed by the Gloria Player to upload and manage signage content.
